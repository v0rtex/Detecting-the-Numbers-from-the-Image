## Introduction

Electricity meters are widely used to measure power consumption in households and businesses. The ability to automatically extract information from images of these meters can be beneficial for various purposes, such as automating billing processes, monitoring power usage, and detecting tampering attempts.

This project utilizes advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and analyze various components of the electricity meter, as follows:

1. **Number Detection**: The system can extract the numeric readings displayed on the meter's screen. This feature is crucial for obtaining consumption data for billing and monitoring purposes.

2. **Terminal Seal Detection**: The system can identify the presence and location of the terminal seal on the meter. Detecting any tampering with the seal can help identify potential unauthorized access or manipulation of the meter.

3. **Sharpwire Detection**: The system can detect the sharpwire, a safety mechanism used to disconnect the power supply in case of emergencies or maintenance.

4. **Earthing Wire Detection**: The system can identify the earthing wire, responsible for ensuring electrical safety by providing a path for fault currents to the ground.

## Features

- Accurate and robust number detection from the meter's screen.
- Reliable identification of the terminal seal, sharpwire, and earthing wire.
- Easy-to-use interface for analyzing meter images.
- Customizable settings for improved performance based on specific image characteristics.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v0rtex/Detecting-the-Numbers-from-the-Image.git
cd Detecting-the-Numbers-from-the-Image
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download pre-trained models (if provided) and place them in the appropriate directories.

## Usage

1. Prepare the meter image: Ensure you have a clear image of the electricity meter ready for analysis.

2. Run the analysis script: Use the provided Python script to analyze the meter image.

```bash
python analyze_meter.py --image path/to/meter_image.jpg
```

3. View the results: The script will display the detected numbers, terminal seal, sharpwire, and earthing wire on the image. Additionally, it may also save the results as a new image or output them to a CSV file, depending on the configuration.
